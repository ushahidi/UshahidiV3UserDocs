# 5.1 Map View

This mode displays all published posts on a map.

* Each post appears as an icon on the map. In the event that you opted to combine nearby posts on your Map settings page ([Section 3.2](../3.-configuring-your-deployment/3.2-general-settings.md) of this manual), posts adjacent to each other on the map will cluster together, displaying a number denoting number of posts combined.
* Clicking on each individual post displays a small pop up box with the _**post title**_ and _**description.**_
* You should also be able to zoom in and out of the map as desired.
