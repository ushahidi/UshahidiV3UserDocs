# 5. Modes for visualizing and managing data on your deployment

The Ushahidi platform provides you with _**modes**_ to not only **visualise** your data in different ways, but to also **manage it**.

We designed “modes” for the discrete and specific actions users need to take within the platform, in a bid to make the platform to be more intuitive and action-oriented for different user types on a deployment.

Ordinary viewers of a deployment can access three different modes as shown below:-

* Map view
* Data view
* Activity view

Signed in users(with the necessary permissions) can access four different modes as shown below:-

* Map view
* Data view
* Activity view
* Settings page

Your ushahidi deployment defaults to the map mode for anyone who visits your homepage(as illustrated above). To change your current mode, select any of the options provided to you from the menu on your left.
