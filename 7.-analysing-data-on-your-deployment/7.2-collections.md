# 8.2 Collections

A “Collection” is a manually-curated grouping of posts. It is not dynamic, meaning the posts within it do not change unless a you manually update them.

You may find collections useful in grouping posts that you would like to share with external partners . For example , you may find it useful to add allposts that require escalation to a collection and then export data in that collection in a CSV file that youcan share with partners.

Please note that only registered users can create Collections. Non registered users can only view featured public collections

The setup in this guide is demonstrated in the below video as well. You can watch and follow the guide at the same time!
