# 6.8 Exporting Data

The platform now allows for data export, enabling you to download posts from the platform in CSV format. You can download posts from your map mode, Data mode, [saved searches](../../7.-analysing-data-on-your-deployment/7.1-saved-searches.md) and [collections](../../7.-analysing-data-on-your-deployment/7.2-collections.md) you have access to, or based on custom criteria( [search filters](../6.2-filtering-posts.md) set by you as a user).

To export a CSV file,

* Click on saved search/collection youâ€™d like to export data from.
  * You can also use the Search section on your header to filter posts you would like to export based on specific criteria
* Once done, click on the **Share** button on the right hand of your header menu.
