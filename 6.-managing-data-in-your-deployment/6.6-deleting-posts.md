# 6.6 Deleting Posts

The ability to delete posts is only available to admins or registered users with adequate permissions. This means that non registered users cannot delete posts.

You can select multiple posts to delete at a time from the post list page, or delete individual posts from the list page, or individual post view page .

To delete

* An individual post from the data view, click on the three dotted icon from the list of detail pane as shown below, then click on _**Delete**_
