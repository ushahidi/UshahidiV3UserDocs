# 6.7 Importing Data

The _**Data Import**_ feature allows you to import posts into the platform. It is particularly useful in cases where:-

* You need to upload posts in bulk
* You need to upload posts that people can’t send to you via email/phone but have the data available in CSV format
* \(In future\) You are transferring data from one platform to another

To import a CSV File,

* On the left hand menu bar, click on _**Settings**_![](../.gitbook/assets/click_on_settings%20%281%29.png)
* Then, click on _**Data Import**_![](../.gitbook/assets/updated_import.png)

* Select a survey you’d like to match the data you’re uploading to. This field is populated with a list of all existing surveys on your deployment.
* Choose the CSV file you would like to upload. **Make sure that**
  * You are uploading a file in CSV format. Any other file formats are not accepted
  * Your CSV file size does not exceed 2MB
  * Your CSV file has Column headers\( these will be useful when mapping your CSV column to the survey fields\)
