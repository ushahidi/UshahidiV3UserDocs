# 6.7 Importing Data

The _**Data Import**_ feature allows you to import posts into the platform. It is particularly useful in cases where:-

* You need to upload posts in bulk
* You need to upload posts that people can’t send to you via email/phone but have the data available in CSV format
* (In future) You are transferring data from one platform to another

To import a CSV File,

* On the left hand menu bar, click on _**Settings**_

&#x20;                                                 _****_                                                  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/Click\_on\_settings (1).png>)

* Then, click on _**Data Import.**_

&#x20;                                                  _****_                                                   ![](../.gitbook/assets/Updated\_Import.png)

  * You are uploading a file in CSV format. Any other file formats are not accepted
  * Your CSV file size does not exceed 2MB
