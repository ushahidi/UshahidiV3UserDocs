# 6. Managing Data in your deployment

A post is a report of a single instance of something in the deployment. It can be made up of many fields, such as Title, Description, Date, Links, and/or location. Ushahidi allows for collection of posts via

* _**SMS**_: These can be configured to come in via SMSSync, FrontlineSMS, Nexmo and Twilio.
* _**Twitter**_: You can pull our tweets based on specific hashtags, search terms, and/or directly from specific accounts.
* _**Email**_: You can configure your deployment to receive post from an email address

_**NB: You can configure SMS, Twitter and Email as data sources as described in**_** ** [_**Section 3.4**_](../3.-configuring-your-deployment/3.4-data-sources.md) ** **_**of this manual**_

* _**Web(your deployment page online)**_: Since Ushahidi is responsive, you can add a post from the web app from any device that can access the internet (a computer, tablet, or mobile phone).
* _**Smartphone apps**_: Our native applications on Android and iOS are still a work in progress at the moment.

This chapter will describe how to manage data coming in from these different sources
