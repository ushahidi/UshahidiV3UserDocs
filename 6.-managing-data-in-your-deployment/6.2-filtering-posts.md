# 6.2 Filtering Posts

Filters can be applied to narrow down a large amount of data. You can filter posts by many types of parameters, for example: _**Surveys, Categories, Status, Date Ranges, and Location.**_

Survey and Category filters are located within the "Filters" modal on the top global search bar, which allows you to

* **sort posts by**
  * Date of creation
  * Post date i.e date when it was assigned to a survey
  * Date updated
*   **filter reports by**

    * _**Saved searches**_
      * By default, every deployment has a set of three featured Saved Searches(read more in the [Saved searches section](../7.-analysing-data-on-your-deployment/7.1-saved-searches.md) of this manual) from which you can view posts on your deployment, from the search filter.These include:-
        * _**Published Posts**_: Lists all posts that have been made public on your deployment(i.e can be viewed by registered/non registered users on your deployment.
        * _**Unknown Posts**_: Lists all messages received from SMS, Email and Twitter, that have not been assigned to a survey i.e are unstructured
        * _**My posts**_: Lists all posts created by you as a user
    * _**Status**_
      * Published: Posts that can be seen by both logged in and non logged in users
      * Under review: Posts that can only be seen by logged in users with adequate permissions
      * Archived: Posts that have been deemed to be irrelevant and removed from your active view
    * Other filters include **Surveys, Categories, Data source, Date range, Location** or any other user determined parameters
