# 4.1 Roles

This feature allows you to set up and manage default and custom roles and permissions for different user groups on your deployment. Each deployment has a **default “Admin” and "Member" role**, which cannot be deleted, but can be edited. The **default “Admin” role** allows for full control over ALL functionality on your deployment, while the **default "Member" role** only grants access to edit their own posts.

To access the roles management page,

* On the left hand menu bar, click on _**Settings**_
