# 4.1 Roles

This feature allows you to set up and manage default and custom roles and permissions for different user groups on your deployment. Each deployment has a **default “Admin” and "Member" role**, which cannot be deleted, but can be edited. The **default “Admin” role** allows for full control over ALL functionality on your deployment, while the **default "Member" role** only grants access to edit their own posts.

The setup in this guide is demonstrated in the below video as well. You can watch and follow the guide at the same time!
