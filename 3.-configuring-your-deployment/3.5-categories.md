## 3.5.1 Adding and Configuring Categories <a href="#3-5-1-adding-and-configuring-categories" id="3-5-1-adding-and-configuring-categories"></a>

Unlike Ushahidi v2.x, your deployment **DOES NOT** come with pre installed/set-up categories. You will need to create this on your new Ushahidi deployment. Categories are now treated as custom fields within a Survey. This gives you the flexibility to add certain categories to some surveys, but not others.

There are two ways to create new categories. First, navigate to _**Settings → Categories**_

* Click on the _**Add Category icon as shown below**_

![Click on the + yellow circle to add a category.](../.gitbook/assets/Add\_category.png)

* In the upper left corner of the category page, you will see the default language that your deployment is currently in.&#x20;

![Click on the + yellow circle to add a category.](<../.gitbook/assets/Add\_Category\_-\_Zipcode254 (1).png>)

* Add the following details
  * _**Category Name:**_** ** Give your category a name that will appear on your homepage and when users are creating new posts.
  * _**Description:**_** ** You can provide a brief description of what kind of information you will fall under this category
  * _**Child / parent settings**_: You can choose to set any category as a “child” to another, creating a hierarchy within the categories themselves, and will reflect this in their positioning on the sidebar.
  * **Default language:** Click on the drop down menu  to select your preferred default language
  * _**Roles**_: You can opt to set your category as visible to specific user roles on your deployment here. This list is populated based on custom roles created. More on [Roles here](../4.-managing-people-on-your-deployment/4.1-roles.md).&#x20;

Once that is done, you can translate the category into other languages.

To do that;

* Click on _ **+ Add**  **translation**_ at the upper right-hand corner of the screen.
* A pop-up module will appear on your screen, click on the dropdown menu, and select the language you want to translate to.

![Select a language you want to translate your content to.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AlaFVn58WDLI88ocitXsbA5-S2rQEhZMgDYwADiTfsLw4DvtFgSRzXRKzZeMXUa7v3YQozhSAP55IymMdBwloJzSLv3fkAdu1bXafNOkf66om5eOtUWLNXNYBZFrPh-919\_gx2kB)

* Click on Add to finish.
* You will be redirected to a page with the translatable content in the default language and fields where you can add your translations.

![Swahili was the language selected for translation](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/44crPYiovrY1JTOZOHB8n2cn8bpK632w0Hg1C-K3IhaY83tFeTCpzaPYmnBPlcbmaWGNjCgKuNcPTPUc1G\_tEXGMEJZJJBT74FhwNA2bHLZJB9onBHFqLuh3VzMLLSD8ivMUFImK)

* On the empty fields, translate the category name and description details into the chosen language e.g in the above image the default language is English and the added language is Swahili.
* Click Save when all is done to create the category. You can now choose to add this category to any of your Surveys.
* Under the category name, you will see the available languages the category has been translated into.

![All the available languages that the content has been translated to are shown.](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/r8rmd9iwJEnOOPCyfZMQz4AYyIAXoAEWbIJQ9aL0kybQluYUM4NWeik4C1YrKidWZ-SgcOUZg5q2sP5qe22RW\_PoraNoYuI0xLlevXwX0t9jF9uPQ\_8Lv-2ABSDutxMabfMlio4b)

****Add categories as custom fields as you build and edit Surveys. First, navigate to **Settings → Surveys,** and either select the already existing Survey you’d like to edit, or create a new Survey.

* Click on _**Add field**_ at the bottom of the survey builder and select \_**Categories** \_from the list of field options&#x20;

![Add categories to a survey.](../.gitbook/assets/Pop\_up\_2\_cat.png)

* Configure the following:
  * _**Name:**_** ** Name or prompt for your survey field
  * _**Show field description:**_** ** Turn this on if you’d like to add a short description or help text to the field
  * _**Which labels should be available:**_** ** Select which categories you’d like to add to the field as options

![Adding a category as a field to a survey. "Add field" modal.](../.gitbook/assets/screen\_shot\_2017-05-31\_at\_121456.png)
