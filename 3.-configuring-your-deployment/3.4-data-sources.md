# 3.4 Data Sources

There are many ways to enter posts into your Ushahidi deployment other than from the deployment itself. This section shows you how to configure all the possible data source types.

_**NB: If you’re a user on ushahidi.com, the number of data source types available to you may be limited, based on the Ushahidi plan you are subscribed to. You may review these from**_ **\*\*\[\_**our plans page_**\]\(**_[https://www.ushahidi.com/pricing](https://www.ushahidi.com/pricing)_**\)**_. For open source/self hosted deployments, all data source types are available to you\*\*\_

To access the data sources configuration page,

* On the left hand menu bar, click on _**Settings**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/click_on_settings.png)

* Then, click on _**Data Sources**_.

![Data sources link in the deployment&apos;s settings page.](../.gitbook/assets/updated_data_sources.png)

## 3.4.1 Email <a id="3-4-1-email"></a>

This section allows you to set up the platform to receive emails from users. Before getting started, make sure that you have an email account set up on Gmail, Yahoo or any other service provider. Make sure that you have IMAP/POP enabled \(For more information on these two protocols, [visit this website](http://www.pop2imap.com/). Instructions on how to enable the IMAP/POP settings in your email can be found here

* Follow this guide to enable IMAP from external clients with [Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?hl=en). Keep in mind:
  * There are a few settings you need to configure so that Ushahidi can pull from a Gmail account.
  * In Gmail Settings, under "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" you need to make sure IMAP is enabled.
  * Then if you go to [https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) you need to turn on access for less secure apps. \(Google's docs here: [https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)\)  
* [Yahoo](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN3697.html)

To get started with email set up,

* Click on _**the drop down icon on the right as shown**_

![](../.gitbook/assets/email.png)

* Input the following email account settings:-
  * _**Incoming server type**_: You have two options to select from, _**POP**_ and _**IMAP**_. We recommend using IMAP if possible because it’s the best way to make sure you can see all your mail at any time on all of your devices
  * _**Incoming server**_: Enter the address of the server where your email services are hosted. E.g _mail.yourwebsite.com_, _imap.gmail.com_ or _pop.gmail.com_
  * _**Incoming server port**_: Enter the port that your email account uses for incoming emails. This is also provided by your service provider and depends on the use of [SSL\(Secure Sockets Layer\)](https://www.digicert.com/ssl.htm)/[Transport Layer Security\(TLS\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) or not. As a standard rule;
    * IMAP uses port 143 , but SSL/TLS encrypted IMAP uses port 993 .
    * POP uses port 110 , but SSL/TLS encrypted POP uses port 995
  * _**Incoming server security**_: You have 3 options to choose from to enhance secure connection to your email mailbox, depending on which is supported by your email service provider.
    * None
    * TLS - [Read more on Transport Layer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)
    * SSL - [Read more on Secure Sockets Layer](https://www.digicert.com/ssl.htm)
  * _**Incoming user name**_: Enter the email address you want to use to receive emails e.g _**sample@youremail.com**_. We recommend setting up a separate email address for this purpose, preferably one that has a lot of available space to avoid the account getting full in a short time, especially if the platform will be receiving a lot of submissions via email.
  * _**Incoming password**_: Enter the password of the email account inserted above.

![Email Datasource configuration.](../.gitbook/assets/email_1.png)

* Click on _**Save**_ _\*\*_and this data source’s settings will be saved. Unstructured posts from email will now be pulled into the platform.

## 3.4.3 FrontlineSMS <a id="3-4-3-frontlinesms-pending"></a>

FrontlineCloud is an online SMS management platform that lets you control and manage 2-way SMS engagement with anyone in the world.

**NB: You need a FrontlineCloud Starter or Pro account to be able to configure this as a data source. To sign up, go to** [**https://cloud.frontlinesms.com**](https://cloud.frontlinesms.com) _\*\*_

**You also need to create a FrontlineSync connection with your mobile phone as a gateway with FrontlineSMS**

To set up your Frontlinesync using your mobile phone;

* Download FrontlineSync from the [Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simlab.frontlinesync)
* You need to accept all permissions that it requests unfortunately or it won't run
* Log in with your Frontline SMS account that you created on the FrontlineCloud platform.

![Enter your FrontlineSMS account credentials](../.gitbook/assets/slack___romina___ushahidi%20%283%29.png)

* Then you need to select how you want the sync to work. You will be presented with a few options.

_**Definition for each option are referenced from the FrontlineSMS documentation**_

* Send messages using this Android
  * _"This option sets whether or not messages are sent from FrontlineCloud or FrontlineSMS to recipients using the Android device as an SMS gateway. If this option is not active, SMS messages will not be sent via FrontlineSync to recipients. Messages sent via FrontlineSync will appear in the native 'Sent Messages' folder within Android phones. There may be limits on the number of messages that the Android device can send over a certain period. Please note these restrictions are from the Android phone, and vary handset to handset"_
* Upload incoming messages from FrontlineSync
  * _"This option sets whether or not incoming SMS to your Android device are sent to your FrontlineCloud or FrontlineSMS workspace. Any and all messages received to the device while FrontlineSync is running will automatically be uploaded to your workspace. If you disabled the app, upon reactivating FrontlineSync, you will be prompted as to whether you wish to upload all SMS received while the app was off. FrontlineSync will attempt to upload an SMS as soon as it arrives on the phone. If unsuccessful, it will retry until successful. The state of every message is maintained and visible in the Activity Log."_
* Upload missed calls from FrontlineSync \[you can leave this one off\]
* It also has an option to select how often you want the synchronization to happen. By default it's 15minutes.

![Select connection options](../.gitbook/assets/slack___romina___ushahidi%20%285%29.png)

* After selecting the options you want, click on _**update**_ to finish configuring Frontlinesync. 
* Click on _**'Done! start using FrontlineSync',**_ you will be taken to a dashboard screen that shows which options are selected.

![FrontlineSync connection options selected](../.gitbook/assets/slack___romina___ushahidi%20%282%29.png)

**WARNING:** FROM THE POINT, FRONTLINE SYNC WILL START SYNCHRONIZING _NEW MESSAGES_ AS THEY COME IN.

* You can change your settings by going to the options in Frontline Sync.
  * Click the gear icon on the top-right side of the screen
  * Click "Settings"
  * You will be taken to a list, tap Options to re-configure your synchronization options.

![Settings Screen](../.gitbook/assets/slack___romina___ushahidi%20%287%29.png)

Now let's get started with FrontlineCloud setup,

* Log into your FrontlineCloud account on [https://cloud.frontlinesms.com](https://cloud.frontlinesms.com)
* Open your deployment as well i.e _name.ushahidi.io_, go to datasource configuration in your setting page then click on FrontlineSMS.

![Data sources &#x2192; Frontline SMS &#x2192; highlighted arrow button to add configuration details for SMS provider.](../.gitbook/assets/frontline.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
FrontlineSMS has announced its [imminent cessation of service](https://www.frontlinesms.com/blog/2021/6/28/frontlinesms-is-closing), with a subsequent release of the source code for its server. Presumably, users will be able to download the code and install their own servers.

As of this writing \(September 2021\), to our knowledge, the source code or any of the files necessary for a server installation haven't been made public yet.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are still enjoying service from FrontlineSMS, in their cloud instance with the address [https://cloud.frontlinesms.com/](https://cloud.frontlinesms.com/), you should use that address as your server address below.
{% endhint %}

* First, you will need to set up your server. Once you do that, copy the server URL and enter it in the 'FrontlineSMS server URL' field in your deployment.
* Click on save.
* Enable/disable the email data source by clicking on the green toggle that appears.
* Click on the toggle to import your messages' response to a survey.
* Select the survey you wish to import your messages to.
* Select which field should be assigned to populate the data from

![Enter the FrontlineSMS server URL &amp; enable configuration.](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot_2021-09-02_at_21_10_42_png%20%281%29.png)

* Next, you will need to generate an API Key in Frontline SMS. To do so, follow the instructions below
  * Go back to [cloud.frontlinesms.com](http://cloud.frontlinesms.com)
  * Click on the gear icon at the top right corner of the page

![APi web services and integrations](../.gitbook/assets/dashboard.png)

* Click on _**API Web services and integrations**_.
* In the screen that comes up, click _**Connect a web service**_

![Connect a web service](../.gitbook/assets/datasource_review_meeting%20%281%29.png)

* You will be shown a list of service types. Click on _**Connect an external web service to your workspace.**_

![Connect an external web service to your workspace](../.gitbook/assets/datasource_review_meeting%20%283%29.png)

* In the popup to create it, just fill in a name for the service. Example: "Ushahidi deployment integration"

![Enter a name for the web service integration](../.gitbook/assets/datasource_review_meeting%20%284%29.png)

* Click _**Save**_
* Once you save this, you will see your API key was created. You can copy it to use it in your integration with Ushahidi Platform.

![Copy the generated API key](../.gitbook/assets/slack___romina___ushahidi%20%284%29.png)

* In the Ushahidi Platform Datasource configuration for Frontline SMS;
  * Enter the FrontlineCloud API KEY that you generated in the previous step in the Api Key field.

![Enter API key](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot_2021-09-02_at_21_10_42_png.png)

* In the Frontline SMS website, go to _**Activities**_

![Activities and create an activity in the FrontlineSMS website](../.gitbook/assets/activities%20%284%29.png)

* Click _**Create an Activity**_
* You will get a screen with a lot of activity options. The one you want is _**Forward to URL**_ as highlighted below

![Click on Forward to Url](../.gitbook/assets/datasource_review_meeting%20%282%29.png)

* You will get a popup to configure the URL forward activity.

![Name your activity, choose a parameter, add the target URL and select HTTP method](../.gitbook/assets/datasource_review_meeting%20%286%29.png)

* Let's fill in the popup:

  * **Name your activity:** use a descriptive name that contains your Ushahidi deployment name + Forward SMS. Example: "_**Forward SMS to my deployment**_". This is just so that in the future you know what's done by an activity vs another.
  * **Send request parameters for** \(You can use the one that fits your needs, by default we are using _**All inbound SMS**_ in phones that are exclusive for this campaign\).

    * **SMS Messages that start with the specified keywords:** this can be useful if you are running multiple campaigns and want to route SMS received by a specific issue. For example, you could decide that only SMS starting with "ELECTIONS2020" will be sent to this Ushahidi deployment.
    * **SMS Messages that contain the specified keywords:** the same as above but instead of only routing SMS that starts with "ELECTIONS2020" you would route any messages that contain that text anywhere. This can be a tricky configuration and generally, it's better to do specific keywords at the beginning instead if you are filtering.
    * **All inbound SMS:** all SMS will be sent to the deployment.

    \*\*\*\*

  * **Target URL:** This is the API Url to your deployment + the endpoint to connect to.

  For [Ushahidi.io](http://ushahidi.io) deployments, the rule is always the same. Given a deployment with the following url "[https://\*\*yourdeploymentname\*\*.\[ushahidi.io\]\(http://ushahidi.io](https://**yourdeploymentname**.[ushahidi.io]%28http://ushahidi.io)\)" + the API Url will be = "[https://\*\*yourdeploymentname.api\*\*.\[ushahidi.io\]\(http://ushahidi.io](https://**yourdeploymentname.api**.[ushahidi.io]%28http://ushahidi.io)\)".

  * Follow this formula to get your Target URL:

    * Your deployment URL: "[https://\*\*yourdeploymentname\*\*.ushahidi.io](https://**yourdeploymentname**.ushahidi.io)"
    * The API URL: "[https://\*\*yourdeploymentname.api\*\*.ushahidi.io](https://**yourdeploymentname.api**.ushahidi.io)"
    * The Target URL then would be ["https://**yourdeploymentname.api**._ushahidi.io_/sms/frontlinesms".](https://yourdeploymentname.api.ushahidi.io/sms/frontlinesms) is what you will enter in the "Target URL" field.

    \*\*\*\*

  * **HTTP Method:** POST

* Then you will need to add key and values that Frontline SMS will use when connecting with the Ushahidi deployment. To start;
  * Click on the _**Add Request parameter**_ button which will add a 3rd key and value fields to the form.

![Click on Add Request Parameter](../.gitbook/assets/activities%20%281%29.png)

* In the first Key field enter **from**. In the Value field next to it, enter **${trigger.sourceNumber}**
  * This will be saved as the sender for the SMS
* In the second Key field enter **message**. In the Value field next to it, enter **${trigger.text}**. This matches the content of the SMS sent.
* In the third Key field enter secret. In the value field next to it, enter a phrase or long password. This will be needed in the Ushahidi Platform as well. Example "_**occupant-gash-gasket-roil**_" \(don't use this! it's just an example\). The secret is supposed to be secret, and it validates the communication between Frontline SMS and the Ushahidi API. Copy the secret into the Ushahidi Platform Frontline SMS configuration as well. Remember: it's case sensitive.

![Fill in the request parameters](../.gitbook/assets/activities%20%282%29.png)

* Click on the _**Save**_ button in Frontline SMS to save the activity.
* Enter a secret code in the SECRET field. This code will be used by FrontlineCloud to connect to the Ushahidi deployment. You can enter any value you like here. It should ideally contain numbers and letters and be ~20 characters long.

![Enter your secret value](../.gitbook/assets/data_sources_-_test254.png)

* Click _**save**_ when done.
* Finally, test that the system is setup correctly by sending a test sms to your number. The message should be forward to the Ushahidi deployment and appear in your list of posts.

_**NB: You need a Twilio account to be able to configure this as a data source. To sign up, go to**_ **\*\*\[\_**[https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio\*\*\_\]\(https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio**_]%28https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)\)

To get started with Twilio set up,

* Log into your twilio account.
* You’ll need to buy a number to use. Click on the _**hashtag icon**_

![Buy a number](../.gitbook/assets/_2__twilio%20%287%29.png)

* Click on the _**red "Plus" icon.**_

![Click on the red \(+\) icon](../.gitbook/assets/_2__twilio.png)

* Select the desired criteria for your phone number In the number selection/purchase screen
  * Select the country where you need a phone number. This is the number that people will use when sending a report through SMS.
  * Location/Number: You can search numbers by digits/phrases or by location. This is optional.
  * Capabilities \(Voice, SMS, Fax, MMS\): Make sure you tick the "SMS" checkbox. We want to make sure Twilio only shows us numbers with SMS capabilities. If it can't be ticked/clicked, then it means that Twilio doesn't have any numbers with SMS capabilities in that country.

![Setting up a Twilio number. Capabilities selected: SMS. Select your Country, and a number. Then hit the search button.](../.gitbook/assets/twilio_console_-_phone_numbers_search.png)

* Click on **\*\*\_**Search\*\*\_. A list of available numbers with their rates based on the criteria set above will appear
* Click _**Buy**_ on the number you’d like to use.

![List of Twilio numbers. Click Buy to get one.](../.gitbook/assets/twilio_console_-_phone_numbers_search_buy_results.png)

* You will be shown a screen like this one below where they confirm all capabilities, the number, and other details. 

![Click the buy button purchase the number](../.gitbook/assets/_2__twilio%20%285%29.png)

* Click the buy button at the bottom right hand of the screen to purchase your number.
* Once you have a phone number, note it down as you’ll need it to configure your data source later on.

### Configuring Ushahidi Platform to use your Twilio phone number

**First, we need to get the following information from your Twilio account:**

* _**Phone Number**_: the number you just purchased. If you forgot it, you click the "_**Hashtag**_" icon in Twilio again to see your available numbers.
* _**Account SID**_
  * Go to [https://www.twilio.com/console/](https://www.twilio.com/console/)
  * You will see a panel like the one below with details about your project. Get the Account SID from it \(we've highlighted it in the screenshot as a reference\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/_2__twilio%20%284%29.png)

* **Auth Token**
  * In the same panel as the account SID, you will see a "_**view**_" link next to "_**Auth token**_" as shown on the diagram above. 
  * Click it, and it will display your account's auth token.

**Next, with the Account SID, Auth Token and Phone number you just obtained:**

* Go to your Datasources settings page on your Ushahidi deployment.
* Click on _**the drop down icon on the right as shown**_

![Twilio data source configuration.](../.gitbook/assets/twilio.png)

* You will see a list of fields like this one

![Twilio datasource configuration in Ushahidi Platform.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xz0ExSYZQgkHNoq8qvJofs5IOqOmOJv1B-qm3MRNoL6bLaGQwXZNPnu0nIAcqCju7AFUzx5WXR3VFifD0QDHPJJ_8AJfDVrwmwWOjyuoaiUnVAiHYf1HhR2jdzabZaJ0tVxJlrr8)

* Enter the following details, which you got earlier from your Twilio Account
  * _**From**_: Enter the phone number you got from Twilio.
  * _**ACCOUNT SID**_: Enter the account SID of your Twilio account
  * _**AUTH TOKEN**_: Enter the Auth Token retrieved from your Twilio account Dashboard page
  * _**SMS Auto Response**_: This will be sent automatically when a user sends a message to your Twilio number. You could use it to provide reference information, like _thanking the user_ or _just confirm receipt._
  * Click on _**Save**_ _\*\*_and this data source’s settings will be saved. Unstructured posts from SMS will now be pulled into the platform from Twilio.
* To enable/disable the Twilio data source and choose which survey to import to, simply click on the green toggles.

![Enable survey submissions from Twilio.](../.gitbook/assets/data_sources_-_test254%20%281%29.png)

* At this point, your Twilio setup in Ushahidi Platform is ready to use but we need to do some follow up tasks in Twilio to connect both of them.

### Twilio setup for Ushahidi Platform SMS connectivity

Go to [https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/runtime/twiml-apps](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/runtime/twiml-apps) where you can create Twiml apps. This is where we can make Twilio aware of the existence of your Ushahidi deployment and help them connect with each other.

![](../.gitbook/assets/_2__twilio%20%283%29.png)

* Click on the red "+" button to create a new app. You will see a screen like the one below.

![Create TwiML App](../.gitbook/assets/_2__twilio%20%282%29.png)

Fill in these details;

* **Friendly name:** Write down a name that helps you remember what this app does. We usually choose the deployment name as the "friendly name" in Twilio.
* **Messaging: I**n this _\*\*_section you will need to add your deployment's Twilio endpoint URL. This is the API Url to your deployment + the endpoint to connect to.

  For [Ushahidi.io](http://ushahidi.io) deployments, the rule is always the same. Given a deployment with the following url "[https://\*\*yourdeploymentname\*\*.\[ushahidi.io\]\(http://ushahidi.io](https://**yourdeploymentname**.[ushahidi.io]%28http://ushahidi.io)\)" + the API Url will be = "[https://\*\*yourdeploymentname.api\*\*.\[ushahidi.io\]\(http://ushahidi.io](https://**yourdeploymentname.api**.[ushahidi.io]%28http://ushahidi.io)\)".

  * Follow this formula to get your _**Request URL**_:
    * Your deployment URL: "[https://\*\*yourdeploymentname\*\*.ushahidi.io](https://**yourdeploymentname**.ushahidi.io)"
    * The API URL: "[https://\*\*yourdeploymentname.api\*\*.ushahidi.io](https://**yourdeploymentname.api**.ushahidi.io)"
    * The _**Request URL**_ then would be ["https://**yourdeploymentname.api**._ushahidi.io_/sms/twilio".](https://yourdeploymentname.api.ushahidi.io/sms/twilio) is what you will enter in the "Request URL" field.

* After you are done with adding Messaging and friendly name, you can click the red "_**Save**_" button.

### Configure your phone number to send messages to Ushahidi platform

* Go to your list of active phone numbers and click on the number you purchased [https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming)
* Click on your number.
* Scroll down and you will see a form like this one.

![Configure with &quot;TwiML App&quot; and Enter the TWIML App friendly name](../.gitbook/assets/twilio_cloud_communications___web_service_api_for_building_voice_and_sms_applications.png)

* In the **configure with** field_**:**_ Select **TwiML App**
* in the **TWIML APP** field**:** Enter the **Friendly name** you created above for your deployment. This will ensure that when you get an SMS, Twilio sends a request to Ushahidi platform to save the message.

### Trying this out

#### Checking that Twilio gets the message

* Send an SMS to the phone number you purchased and configured \(ie from your own phone\).
* You can validate that messages are getting to Twilio by going to the Programmable SMS logs [https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/logs](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/logs)
* You will see the messages your Twilio number has received and sent in the list
* The list will look like this. You can click on the red link under "Date" to see the details of each message.

![SMS Logs](../.gitbook/assets/_2__twilio%20%281%29.png)

* Example of a single message below.
