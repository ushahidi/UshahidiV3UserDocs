# 3.3 Surveys

If you’re someone who uses Ushahidi v2, _**Surveys**_** ** (previously referred to as _**post types)**_ in v3 are what we used to refer to as custom forms. A survey defines critical aspects of a post’s structure and permissions. For example, a post’s “survey” defines which fields are available for contributors to complete, and who can see it when it’s published.

This section will show you how to create and manage surveys on your deployment.

_**NB: If your deployment is hosted on ushahidi.com, usage limits may apply, based on the Ushahidi plan you are subscribed to. You may review these from**_** ** [_**our plans page**_](https://www.ushahidi.com/pricing)_**.**_&#x20;

The setup in this guide is demonstrated in the below video as well. You can watch and follow the guide at the same time!

Managing Fields
{% endembed %}

Each survey you create will have a title and description field by default. It's important to note these fields can be edited, _**but cannot be deleted**_.

#### 3.3.1.1.1 Adding Fields

You can add as many custom fields to your survey as you see fit.To add a new field,

* Click on **Add Field**

![](../.gitbook/assets/Add\_field.png)

* A pop up box with a list of different field types will appear on your screen. Choose whichever one will work best for the type of data you are trying to capture.

!["Add field" modal.](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JZBsDOl1q-3rC9YN\_sOnfCgmGeppWJXZhFRQ98q4MBxdex-oA1urp2r6PXX0nHL-3Ij3BwSmRiTjdz\_EtKzvhl3BhyDXrnR5ABA\_Lev3sXQf4SYog2Vtw1e0yR3tkJguni8shAa)

*   Add the following details

    * _**Name:**_ This is what is displayed as a label for your newly created field
    * _**Add field description (optional):**_ A visual editor should appear below, you may add help text that provides additional details about this field.
      * Add some text in the description-editor, format it however you want to, and as long text as you want to.
    * _**Required:**_ If set to yes, post submission will be only be successful once this field has been filled out. If set to no, post submission will be successful even if it has not been filled out.
    * _**Make responses private**_: This allows limiting access to responses to this field to specific users.
    * _**Default Value:**_ You can set a default value displayed every time someone is creating a new post. example, a survey asks whether you want to subscribe to a service, and it has a default value of 'No'.\
      If you submit without changing this value, the default value will be submitted as 'No' when you save the survey. If you change to 'Yes', the value that will be submitted will be 'Yes'. That's the value that will be submitted when the survey is saved.

    _**NB: For fields where it's possible to add a default value (all field-types except "image", and "categories"), the default value box should be displayed with no toggle-switch**_

    * _**Field Options:**_ This appears in cases where you’re creating a checkbox, select or radio button field. You can add as many options as you would like.

![Adding a field.](../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot\_120519\_045917\_PM.jpg)

### 3.3.1.2 Tasks

You can organize your survey into “Tasks”, allowing a deployment to add fields related to actions that need to be taken, like translation or verification. These groups of tasks are visible to specified users and can be marked as ‘complete.’ For example, if a particular survey requires verification upon submission, you can design a task to ensure your team knows the post needs to be verified before publishing. The task could include fields like whether the information was verified or not, who verified the information, how they verified it, and when they verified it. After verification, the task can be marked as complete and the post can either be moved to the next task if necessary, or published.

#### 3.3.1.2.1 Building Tasks

To add a new task,

* Click on Add Task on your survey creation/edit page

![](../.gitbook/assets/Add\_task.png)

* A small pop up box will appear, prompting you to give your task a name
* If you’d like to make this task required before post submission, toggle the _**Require this task be completed before a post can be visible to the public button**_. This means that, a post will not be published until this task is marked as complete
* Click on _**Add & Close**_

![Add task popup with "Task name", "Task description" and task completion requirements.](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xIJ9akufvgs7LQnOYLf3lyoswMsOOdboXM8Q6TtbVP43inHHfOkJDWVSw5Ws\_b4FfHk0EN7ZBn5ShmEUnD7SViUsC-JzkxRxRBgCCUkY5OqwwGP44m827BsjKDIMV9w438mCuxfz)
